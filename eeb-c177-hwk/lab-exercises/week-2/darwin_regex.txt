Using look ahead and look behind I specify a selection following a end of sentence 
punctuation that is any words or punctuation (since no first word had numbers). The
selection was to stop at the space after the word. This did not select the first word
"Natural" so I added an or command to select it. the ^ works for this because the whole
paragraph is treated as a string so only the first Natural is selected.
